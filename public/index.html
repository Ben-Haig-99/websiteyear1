                <p>My name is Ben Haig and I study computer science at Staffordshire University.  This website was made for the web development and operating systems module in order to present my skills.</p>
                <p>I am 21 years old and go to university via studying computer science at Leeds City College for 2 years prior to coming to Staffordshire University.  Before my studies in computer science I studied and worked as a chef at college and different restaurants.</p>
                <p>During my free time I do enjoy other forms of entertainment however such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Table Tennis</li>
                        <li>Football</li>
                        <li>Video Games</li>
                        <li>Cooking</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>What do I study?</h2>
                <p>I study computer science and I am currently in the first year which is a more generic set of core modules which almost all similar courses are studying, these are the basics which can help you decide or confirm which path of computer science you would like to go down.</p>                    
                <p>The 4 core modules which are studied in the first year are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Digital Technologies</li>
                        <li>Networking Concepts and Cyber Security</li>
                        <li>Software Development and Application Modelling</li>
                        <li>Web Development and Operating Systems</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>Each of these modules is quite self explanatory what they're about and they are all quite unique from eachother meaning for the second year you're more likely to focus down 1 of these modules for the job you're looking at in the future.</p>

                <h2>My future plans</h2>
                <p>The module I like the most from the first year is Software Development and Application Modelling which helped me decide that in the second year of university I would like to take the software related modules for my 2 optional modules.</p>
                <p>I would like to be a software engineer once finished with university as I find this the most similar to the areas of computer science that I enjoy and would be interested in persuing it further to know more about the subject such as more languages.</p>
