                <h3 class = "mainTitle">Python</h3>
                <p class = "mainText">In semester 1 we covered python which is an interpreted, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.  It is a very simple and easy language to learn for newcomers to coding which explains why we started with it.  We used python in a procedural format which means the code is just a series of stepts the code must complete to reach the end instead of using objects.  It mostly comprises of functions to allow the reuse of certain actions for more efficient code.</p>

                <h3 class = "mainTitle">C Sharp</h3>
                <p class = "mainText">In semester 2 we have been doing C sharp which is also a high level programming language but slightly more complicated than python due to its majority use for object oriented programming.  C sharp was developed by Microsoft and the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and International Standards Organisation (ISO).  With this many companies working on it you can see why it is so popular as well as a good start for new programmers with plenty of prompts when used on programs such as visual studio.</p>

                <h3 class = "mainTitle">Modelling</h3>
                <p class = "mainText">Software modelling is the design stage of creating a program.  There is different diagrams that can be made to help plan before starting production such as class diagrams, sequence diagrams and activity diagrams.  Software such as visio makes this much easier to do with pre-created shapes for different types of diagrams ready at hand.  Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardised modeling language similar to visio as a program for helping developers visualise and construct and plan for their program.</p>
