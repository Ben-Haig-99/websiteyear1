                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p>CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) are used for formatting HTML pages such as changing background colour, font or sections to the page.  It is done on a seperate page to the HTML and linked in the header of the HTML.  You can also use CSS to edit how the page will look on a desktop and a mobile in order to make it more available to everyone from everywhere.</p>
            </div>
            <div class = "box-8 box">
                <h2>ECMAscript</h2>
                <p>ECMAscript is a programming language used for web development.  It is a client-side language meaning the source code is processed by the client's web browser rather than on the web server.  ECMAscript can be embedded into the HTML file or done in a seperate js file which can be linked in the header the same as the css does.</p>

        <!--Design 1 section-->
        <div>
            <h2><a href = "Design1.html" class = "linkTitle">Design 1</a></h2>
            <p class = "skillsText align">This design shows a different use of the navigation bar to the normal website as it is a dropdown menu which takes up less space and sits in the top left corner of the screen at all times so its also accessible from everywhere on the page.  The links to other pages are icons to represent the page you are going to and to take up less space on the screen.  The layout changes 3 times with the size of the screen growing showing how css can completely alter it without any html changes.</p>
            <p class = "align">Please click the 'Design 1' title in order to access this example.</p>
        </div>

        <!--Design 2 section-->
        <div>
            <h2><a href = "Design2.html" class = "linkTitle">Design 2</a></h2>
            <p class = "skillsText align">The second design uses the same icones for the navigation bar which the first design does but instead of them being in a dropdown menu they are in the header, however change location depending on the size of the screen in order to be in the most convenient place.  The colour palette is different again for this with colours in the header being similar to the body to have a good transition.  The layout in this page also changes with each different size screen showing more designs possible with the same css, the pictures are differently sized to the first design to show different possibilities that all look in good.</p>

            <p class = "skillsText align">This page shows how ECMAscript or more modernly known JAVAscript can be used to create a form page for ordering.  In this example the user is ordering a coffee and is given multiple options to change the final price and add to order/ place order buttons to function in finalising the order.</p>
